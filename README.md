### Windows Installation

1. Download the Windows executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/lukeeeeeeeeeeee/master-server-generator/releases) section.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.
3. Run the executable to complete the installation.

### Linux Installation

1. Download the Linux binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/lukeeeeeeeeeeee/master-server-generator/releases) section.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the download location.
3. Make the binary executable:
   ```bash

   ```
4. Run the binary to complete the installation.

## Usage

Using msgen is straightforward. After installation, you can generate a server binary with a simple command.

### Basic Command

To generate a new server, use the following command:

```bash
msgen create <server-name>
```

Replace `<server-name>` with your desired server name. This command will create a new server binary in the current directory.

### Options

You can customize the server generation with various options. For example:

- `--port`: Specify the port on which the server will listen.
- `--config`: Provide a path to a configuration file.
- `--daemon`: Run the server as a daemon.

### Example

To create a server named "my-server" that listens on port 8080, you would run:

```bash
msgen create my-server --port 8080
```

## Configuration

After generating your server, you may want to configure it. The generated server will create a configuration file in the same directory. You can edit this file to adjust settings like:

- **Logging Level**: Control the verbosity of logs.
- **Database Connections**: Set up connections to databases.
- **Service Settings**: Adjust service-specific settings.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
log_level: info
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
```
